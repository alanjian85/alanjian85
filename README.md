## Hello world!

### About me
My name is Alan Jian. I'm a Taiwanese high school student at [Wu-Ling Senior High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu-Ling_Senior_High_School). I am incredibly passionate about **programming** and **everything tech-related**! I'm particularly interested in **operating system development** and **computer graphics**. Since I was in primary school, I have spent **over ten years** attempting to learn everything there is to know more about computer science. In addition, I'm eager to know practical parts of mathematics like **calculus** and **linear algebra**. You can find my blog [here](https://alanjian85.github.io/).
